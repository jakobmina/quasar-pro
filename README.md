## 🧬 Overview

**Aether Rescue** is a high-fidelity tactical simulation exploring the boundaries of **Metriplectic Dynamics**. As a Pilot, you interface with the Aether Neural Network to rescue fragmented data shards while managing system corruption and defending against entropic viral entities.

The simulation is built upon the **Mandato Metriplético**, ensuring a rigid balance between conservative (symplectic) and dissipative (metric) forces, preventing both numerical explosion and thermal death.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🎧 Procedural Sound Synthesis
- **Zero-Asset Audio**: All sound effects are generated in real-time using the **Web Audio API**.
- **Dynamic Feedback**: High-tech pulses for shooting, filtered noise for explosions, and frequency chirps for the *Quantum Purge*.
- **Immersion**: Adaptive engine hum (thrust) that reacts to pilot input.

### ⚛️ Metriplectic Physics Engine
- **Symplectic Component**: Reversible energy conservation based on Hamiltonian dynamics.
- **Metric Component**: Entropy-driven relaxation using dissipative potentials.
- **Golden Operator ($O_n$)**: Structured vacuum modulation governed by the Golden Ratio ($\phi \approx 1.618$).

### 🛰️ Tactical Systems
- **Neural Hull Models**: Multiple ship configurations (Interceptor, Tank, Scout).
- **Modular Armament**: Adaptive weapons including Railguns, Machine Guns, and the devastating Infernal Ray.
- **Quantum Purge**: A high-energy field stabilization for clearing widespread corruption.
- **Tactical Systems**: Ship models, primary/secondary armament, Quantum Purge, and long-range radar.
- **Auto-Update System**: Integrated frictionless updates via `electron-updater` (Linux/Windows).

### 🌌 Deep Space Exploration (New!)
- **Quasiperiodic World Generation**: The universe is generated using a determinstic **Golden Operator** ($O_n$), creating a vast, non-repeating coordiante space.
- **Golden Hubs**: Discover rare, stable pockets of order amidst the chaos. These hubs contain **Aether Core Treasures** that permanently upgrade your ship.
- **Mission System**: Track your exploration depth and complete objectives to unlock new challenges.

### 👾 Advanced Adversaries
- **Kamikaze Swarms**: Erratic, high-speed viral entities that seek to collide with your hull.
- **MotherShips**: Massive, heavily armored fortresses that deploy smaller Scout units.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Core**: React 19 + TypeScript
- **Desktop**: Electron for standalone execution.
- **Intelligence**: Google Gemini AI logic for neural network flavor.
- **Performance**: High-speed Canvas-based rendering engine.
- **Build System**: Vite for ultra-fast development.

## 🕹️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+)
- NPM

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jakobmina/quasar-pro.git
   cd quasar-pro
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment:**
   Create a `.env.local` file and add your Gemini API Key:
   ```env
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Run Development Server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Launch Desktop App (Electron):**
   ```bash
   npm run electron:dev
   ```

## 🔄 Auto-Update Mechanism

Aether Rescue includes a robust auto-update system powered by **GitHub Actions** and **electron-updater**.

1. **Seamless Updates**: The app checks for new releases on startup.
2. **Background Download**: Updates are downloaded silently while you play.
3. **Instant Install**: Next time you restart the game, you'll be on the latest version.

## 📜 Physics Mandate

Every dynamic system in this simulation follows the **Three Rules of the Mandato Metriplético**:
1. **Symplectic**: Hamiltonian $H$ for conservative motion.
2. **Metric**: Dissipation potential $S$ for attractor relaxation.
3. **Structured Vacuum**: Modulation by the Golden Operator $O_n$.
